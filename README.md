# Asinc
This code is an asynchronous program for filtering data in a JSON file based on a key and value. It reads data from a JSON file, filters it by the key and value, and then writes the filtered data to a new JSON file.
It requires importing the following libraries: json, logging, argparse, asyncio, aiofiles, and types from typing.
Logging is configured to display information about the program's execution.
